For environment consultants, the Order mandates adherence to sustainable waste directives, underscoring the need for rigorous waste treatment methodologies.\\n\\nAlthough the Order was later revoked by The Environment (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, ensuring compliance with the original Directive's provisions remains essential until new regulations are fully enforced. This includes aspects like waste hierarchy, recycling targets, and extended producer responsibility, which align with ISO standards such as ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.\\n\\nFrom a compliance perspective, businesses, especially in the waste management sector, must remain vigilant to shift regulations and ensure their practices are up-to-date with current legislation.
