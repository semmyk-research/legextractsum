## Gen AI prompt to summarise an aspect of legislation
## This is a baseline that can be tweaked as needed.
## It can be used within a (Python) script or directly on a GenAI prompt.
## target_url is the url of the specific legislation. It can come from a dataset or for direct prompt on a GenAI like GPT-4o, the direct link. 
## leg_text is the content of the legislation. It can come from a dataset. For direct prompting on a GenAI, it's the content from 'target_url'. 
#Question2: Provide the link to the full legislative document ('Open whole Instrument'): This is the link to 'htmLink' (or 'pdfLink') within <div> 'printOptions'\n
